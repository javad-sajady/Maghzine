Maghzine
Maghzine was a series of games designed to help identify ADHD based on user performance. My role in the project involved analyzing gameplay data to detect patterns associated with ADHD traits.

Despite facing several challenges—most notably, a lack of sufficient data to make statistically robust conclusions—we managed to achieve promising results. Our model outperformed comparable studies by nearly 20%. However, due to computational limitations and the inability to secure funding for further data collection, the project could not be continued or published.
